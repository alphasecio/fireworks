[Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai) is a platform for hosting and running machine learning (ML) models with a cloud API, without having to manage your own infrastructure. Sign up for an account at Fireworks and get an [API key](https://fireworks.ai/settings/users/api-keys), which you'll need for this project. 

This repository showcases a simple Streamlit app for running the following open-source text and image generation models on Fireworks AI:
* Text: Meta Llama 3.3 70B Instruct
* Text: Google Gemma 3 27B Instruct *(currently unavailable in serverless mode)*
